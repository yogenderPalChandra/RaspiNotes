RPi1:

appDhtWebHistWithMySQL.py

mainFileUsingMysql.py

RPi2:

#Main file which saves all teh data in a lol is:
mysql2RPi1.py

# this file saves data as a dict{a:1, b:2, c:3, ...} and also as dict{a: [1,2,3], b:{1,2,3}, c:{1,2,3},...} (so if I need dict for my calculations I
# can use this file)
allRpis2MqttClient.py

# be wary run the mainFileUsingMysql.py file in the RP1 (122) before running allRpis2MqttClient.py or mysql2RPi1.py. because otherwise there will no
# no data stored and teh same data will be repeated in RP1 clients

#Regarding working with the web application:
# The main filw now is: Its taking flow as well as all the temperature values
sudo python3 flowAppMySQL.py
#sometimes maximum samples would not take more than 60 numbers even though maximum number of rows is higher tham 400. In this case just restart the server:

#sudo python3 appDhtWebHistWithMySQL.py

# appDhtWebHistWithMySQL.py is the new file accomdating the Mysql rather than sqlite3.

#In RPi1 main file is now: 

sudo python3 mysql2RPi1.py

# It remotly connects to Rpi1 and saves teh data in a lol, while there is no replication so  mysqlReplicatedServer.py is not usefuk which takes replication of DB

# in Rpi1 mainFileUsingMysql.py is teh main file. So run it to save all teh pt100 data to Mysql

sudo python3 mainFileUsingMysql.py
