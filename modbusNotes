#Modbus slave devices can be visualized as having an internal spread sheet filled with numbers. 

#The "columns" in a Modbus device's "spread sheet" are more formally known as register types. 
#Register type may be a coil, a discrete input (aka #status input), an input register, or a holding register.

#The "rows" in a Modbus device's "spread sheet" are simply the register number. 
#Most often, these start at 1 and count up sequentially. Some devices might not have a register 1, and their first register may be number 100 for #example.


#Check in the register/ or in the windows program of the wattmeter that the other power consumed by the other two non main
#phases can be the power consumed by teh circulatng pump. If it is then, We can mention that toatal Power
#consumption is actually leading to COP. Because, Total Power  = Power compressor + power Circulating.
#And one of the phase might be used by circulating pump. check it that power is also rising in other non  main phases. Eg p2 and p3

# cop = hourly or each second or each half second, or what? may be just save the data each half second
